## 🔧 Testing Tools

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Install testing dependencies
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test lighthouse axe-core

# Run automated tests
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:performance
npm run test:accessibility
```

### Manual Testing Tools

#### Browser DevTools
- **Performance Tab**: Monitor frame rates and memory
- **Lighthouse**: Audit performance and accessibility
- **Network Tab**: Check loading times and sizes
- **Console**: Monitor for errors and warnings

#### Accessibility Tools
- **axe DevTools**: Automated accessibility testing
- **WAVE**: Web accessibility evaluation

## 📱 Mobile Testing Procedure

### Setup
1. Enable mobile device simulation in DevTools
2. Test on actual devices when possible
3. Use remote debugging for mobile browsers
4. Test both portrait and landscape orientations

### Touch Interactions
- [ ] Swipe gestures work for navigation
- [ ] Touch targets are minimum 44px
- [ ] Hover states work on touch devices
- [ ] Pinch-to-zoom doesn't break layout

### Mobile Performance
- [ ] Animations are smooth on lower-end devices
- [ ] Images are appropriately sized
- [ ] JavaScript execution doesn't block UI
- [ ] Battery usage is reasonable

## 🌐 Cross-Browser Testing

### Feature Detection
```javascript
// Test for required features
const hasIntersectionObserver = 'IntersectionObserver' in window;
const hasRequestAnimationFrame = 'requestAnimationFrame' in window;
const hasES6Modules = 'noModule' in HTMLScriptElement.prototype;
```

### Fallback Testing
- [ ] CSS animations work when GSAP fails to load
- [ ] Static content displays when JavaScript is disabled
- [ ] Images show when lazy loading fails
- [ ] Navigation works without smooth scrolling

### Progressive Enhancement
